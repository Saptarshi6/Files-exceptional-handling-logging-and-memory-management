        "     executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2] What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ans- Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows you to gracefully handle runtime errors (exceptions)\n",

        "\n",
        "Q13] Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "ans- If memory is not freed properly, a program can consume excessive memory, slowing down or even crashing the system.Python’s garbage\n",
        "     collector automatically removes unused objects to prevent memory leaks.Efficient memory management ensures that a program runs faster\n",
        "      by keeping only necessary objects in memory.Python reuses memory for small objects (like integers and strings) using object pooling.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14] What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "\n",
        "ans- The try and except blocks are used to handle errors gracefully in Python programs. Instead of crashing, the program catches exceptions\n",
        "     and continues execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15]  How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "\n",
        "ans- Python’s garbage collection (GC) system automatically manages memory by reclaiming unused objects, preventing memory leaks. It does this using:\n",

        "Python defines five main logging levels:\n",
        "\n",
        "Level\tNumeric Value\tPurpose\n",
